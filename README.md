# Form Validation Project

This project is a form validation example with a focus on modern JavaScript practices, SASS for styling, and a playful Neuromorphism design. It demonstrates how to use closures for encapsulating data, composing functions for better form handling, and the `FormData` constructor to gather form data efficiently.

## Features

- **Form Validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled and passwords match.
- **Dynamic Form Data Handling**: Uses the `FormData` constructor to collect all form data.
- **SASS for Styling**: Utilizes custom functions, mixins, maps, and partials for modular and maintainable CSS.
- **Neuromorphism Design**: Implements a fun and modern design approach.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For form validation and data handling.
- **SASS**: For custom functions, mixins, maps, and modular CSS.
- **HTML5**: Markup structure.
